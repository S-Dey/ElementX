# ElementX
A Project developed in classic DOS-based Turbo C++ using the BGI graphics library.

## About

ElementX allows you to browse the properties of each element in the Periodic Table of Elements.

This project was being developed by me and my other teammates for [CBSE](http://cbse.nic.in/newsite/index.html)'s AISSCE Computer Science Investigatory Project in 2014.

## Requirements

Turbo C++ 3.0 with the BGI library. 

## Notes
  - Turbo C++ is discontinued and ancient. So, you might run into troubles running it under DOSBox in the latest version of Windows. 
  - Unless you are an Indian Class 12 student who is supposed to work in the ancient Turbo C++, you shouldn't consider it a rock-solid project to contribute to.
