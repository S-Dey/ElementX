# ElementX
A Project developed in classic DOS-based Turbo C++ using the BGI Library.

## About

ElementX allows you to browse the properties of each element in the Periodic Table of Elements.

This project was being developed by me and my other teammates for CBSE's AISSCE Computer Science Investigatory Project in 2014.

## Requirements

Turbo C++ 3.0 with the BGI Library. 

## Notes

  - Turbo C++ is discontinued and so are you encouraged to look away from it. 
  - You can only use this project to get some idea about how the BGI graphics library used to work. 
  - Unless you are an Indian Class 12 student who is supposed to work in the ancient Turbo C++, you shouldn't consider it a rock-solid project to contribute to.
